# What is Moody?

## Introduction

Moody is a Discord Multipurpose Bot made to help server owners guard themselves against raiders, spammers, rogue admins, webhooks, and much more. It comes with every bot feature all in one for the price of nothing. All we ask in favor is your satisfaction.

## History

Moody was created on October 7th, 2021. It is the most polished and advanced version of a series of bots that were created to protect our servers and enhance them.

Frequent raiders and nukers led to the creation of our first security bot, Kobo, in 2019. As our Kobo project outgrew our server, we rebranded as Moody to simply offer everyone our knowledge after expertise in server moderation. Our first idea was "Mod Bot" but that just didn't have a catch to it, so we named it Moody Bot. Why is the profile picture a cow? Well, you can guess... Moooooooody! We understand how frustrating nukers and raiders can be, and how devastating it is to lose out on a great community due to moderation inconsistencies - that's where Moody comes on.

## Current Moody

The current Moody is a completely new bot made with great care security and efficient response time in mind. It can handle a very large amount of servers and members. **All commands** can be customized according to admin preferences and it scales very well with servers with huge growth rates. We believe it does its job **very efficiently**.
