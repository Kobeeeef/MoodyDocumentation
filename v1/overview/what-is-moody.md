# What is Moody?

## Introduction

Moody is a Discord Security and Moderation Bot made to help server owners guard themselves against raiders, spammers, rogue admins, webhooks and much more. It deals with nukes and raids in an efficient manner giving you proper logs and taking proper steps to retain the server's integrity. It also comes with a diverse range of moderation commands that can be customized according to the server admins' standards.&#x20;

## History

Moody was created on October 7th, 2021. It is the most polished and advanced version of a series of bots that were created to protect our servers.

Frequent raiders and nukers led to the creation of our first security bot, Kobo, in 2019. As our Kobo project outgrew our server, we rebranded as Moody to simply offer everyone our knowledge after expertise in server moderation. Our first idea was "Mod Bot" but that just didn't have a catch to it, so we named it to Moody Bot. Why is the profile picture a cow? Well you can guess... Moooooooody! We understand how frustrating nukers and raiders can be, and how devastating it is to lose out on a great community due to moderation inconsistencies - that's where Moody comes on.

## Current Moody

The current Moody is a completely new bot made with great care with security and efficient response time in mind. It can handle a very large amount of servers and attacks. **Almost all moderation commands** can be customized according to admin preferences and it scales very well with servers with huge growth rates. We believe it does its job **very efficiently**.
