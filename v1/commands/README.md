# Commands

## Introduction

We wanted to give you guys the best commands possible (and there are a lot more planned!) but with only one goal: We wanted both newbies and advanced users to be able to use Moody's commands. Each command has the basic use and the advanced one to provide the most possible customizability you guys want.

There are 3 categories regarding Moody's commands

* **Moderation**: This covers all of Moody's awesome moderation commands like Kick, ban, mute, unmute, purge, warn, and unban. These commands provide pretty much **everything you need in terms of moderation**!
* **Settings**: This covers pretty much all the settings commands that cover all of Moody's features and systems. Anything that changes Wick's behavior in a way is covered here.
* **General**: These commands do not necessarily cover Moody's functionality. They simply provide more help. Oh and stats.

## Global Format



* **`Moderation`**: All moderation commands follow this one unique format: /**`command TARGET PARAMETERS`**
  * **TARGET**: It's usually the member(s) you want to apply an action on.
  * **PARAMETERS**: Moderation has different extra parameters but one golden rule is: **Parameters come after TARGET!!**\
    Each moderation command has it's set of parameters you can see by visiting their pages.
