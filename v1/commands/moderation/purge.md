{% hint style="info" %}
### `!purge <NO.-OF-MESSAGES> <USER/PARAMETER>` <a href="#w-purge-less-than-no.-of-messages-greater-than-less-than-user-parameter-greater-than" id="w-purge-less-than-no.-of-messages-greater-than-less-than-user-parameter-greater-than"></a>
{% endhint %}

### `Number of messages` <a href="#number-of-messages" id="number-of-messages"></a>

You must provide this so that Moody actually knows **how many messages** it's going to purge.

* **`!purge X`** is the syntax!

{% hint style="info" %}
**For example,** if you want to purge the last **`100 messages`** sent in a channel, run the command **`!purge 100`** in that specific channel!
{% endhint %}

### `<INPUT>` <a href="#less-than-input-greater-than" id="less-than-input-greater-than"></a>

Input can be the **user/role/bot** depending on what you want to purge. The syntax is **`!purge X <USER>`** where **`X`** is the **number of messages to be purged** and is the **ID/Mention/Name** or the specified user. **For example,** if you want to purge the last **`25 messages`** sent in a channel by a user named **bob**, run the command **`!purge 25 bob`** in that specific channel!

{% hint style="info" %}
You can **mention the member, type out their username, their tag, or even their** [**ID**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)â€‹You don't have to type the full thing if you are sure it's the only member with a **`username/tag/id`** that starts with what you want to provide, for an example, I only that **juju** is the only member with such a name, I can just do **`!purge 50 ju`** and Moody would delete **`50`** messages sent by **juju**. You can provide a **webbook ID** or even name if you want to target that **webbook's messages**. **You can mention the role, type out's name or event it's ID if you want to target all messages sent by members who happen to have the role.**
{% endhint %}

### `<PARAMETERS>` <a href="#less-than-parameters-greater-than" id="less-than-parameters-greater-than"></a>

Parameters are the purge options you can pass if you want extra input or a custom behaviour. **They must come after the number of messages!**If you want to target **a specific kind of message**, you need to use this parameter and actually provide the **`<PARAMETER>`** you need. If this parameter is used, **`<INPUT>`** has to be just a number!
