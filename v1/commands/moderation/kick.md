**You don't have to type the full thing if you are sure it's the only member with a `username`/`tag`/`ID` that starts with what you want to provide, for an example, I only that `Salvi0#0101` is the only member with such a name, I can just do `!kick salv` and Moody would pick it up.**

* If it's a username, a tag or an ID.
